# Hello World Repo
- This is a simple Hello World repository that defines an interface with a single function that prints "Hello World\r\n"
- Use this repo as an example of a source code repository with the required structure and CMakeLists.txt files to be compatible with the development environment defined in the `software-development-environment` repository.
- Refer to the `software-repeat-hello-world` repository for an example of a project that has a dependency on another micromouse software project

## Creating Your Own Software Repository
  - Below are all the changes you need to make to create your own software repository:
    - **software-hello-world/**
      - top level project directory
      - must be renamed for your software (`software-whatever-you-want`)
        - GitHub doesn't support nesting/grouping repositories- `software-` prefix helps see that the repo is a software repo
    - software-hello-world/**main.c**
      - just a file for if you need to flash some test code to the MCU
      - customize as needed
    - software-hello-world/**CMakeLists.txt**
      - top level CMakeLists.txt file
      - `hello_world_lib` must be renamed for your software unit's library (`whatever_you_want_lib`)
      - all of your interface subdirectories must be made explicit with `target_include_directories()`
      - establish links to other micromouse software on GitHub in this file
    - software-hello-world/**hello-world/**
      - an interface under your software unit
      - you can have as many interfaces as you want, but they each need their own CMakeLists.txt file and tests/ folder
    - software-hello-world/hello-world/**print_hello_world.c & .h**
      - you can define whatever interface files you want
    - software-hello-world/hello-world/**CMakeLists.txt**
      - interface level CMakeLists.txt file
      - all .c source files defined in the interface must be explicitly included with `target_sources()`
      - `hello_world_lib` again must be renamed for your software unit's library
    - software-hello-world/hello-world/**tests/**
      - test directory for the hello_world interface
      - all .cpp CppUTest files for your interface are defined here
    - software-hello-world/hello-world/**CMakeLists.txt**
      - test level CMakeLists.txt file
      - all "test source files" (.cpp CppUTest files and their associated .c source files being tested) must be listed out as a part of the `LOCAL_TEST_SOURCES` variable
      - `test_hello_world` must be renamed according to what interface this is a test unit for (`test_whatever_interface`)
    - software-hello-world/hello-world/**test_print_hello_world.cpp**
      - CppUTest file for your interface
